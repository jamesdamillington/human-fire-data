# Human Fire Data

This repository contains code for analysing three global databases of human fire, plus data from the Global Fire Emissions Database.

It also contains high-resolution figures from outputs of code that were subsequently edited in inkscape, as follows:
- [Figure 1](png/GEO_fig1.png). Suppression Level from DAFI (case study points) and GFUS (region polygons) data. 
- [Figure 2](png/GEO_fig2.png). Difference in burned area (cell fraction) between GFED4s and GFED5 products (grid data) with location of LIFE case study locations (points).
